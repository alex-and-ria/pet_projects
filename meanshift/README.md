Meanhift is written on C++. Several C libraries are also used in this implementation.

Meanshift algorithm is not very fast, so to improve its output, more iterations should be done 
(this parameter defined with "#define" statement).

As input .ppm (RGB) images with 3 bytes per pixel are allowed. The input image name is defined with "#define" statement.
Output image name can be in form [input_image_name_without_its_extension]_outp[input_image_name_extension]

In the folder "ppms" test image and output image are included.

If you have questions or ideas for improving this project, don't hesitate and mail me (alex.and.riaqqq@gmail.com).
